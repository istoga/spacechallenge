## Overview
Space Challenge is a coding problem suggested by Angela Yu in the Web Dev course. I am taking on this challenge with primary solutions using only html and css at this time. I have never used a .fig design file before so this will stretch me. I anticipate having a little bit of a curve in learning how to use figma effectively, but see it as a worthwhile investment in how to use a program that allows for realtime collaboration with others. This will prove useful for the future since I will be able to interact with designers, developers and other stakeholders.

### The challenge
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process
1. Start by understanding how to use Figma.
2. Building out each page methodically with HTML first.
3. Going behind after all the structure is complete and adding in styling with CSS.
4. Grasping how to use Figma effectively for future projects.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
